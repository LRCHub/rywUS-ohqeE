VERSE 1
No one can win here
There's just so much to lose
So go before you can't leave from here
There's just so much to lose
VERSE 2
No one ever reaches there
They don't have a clue
They leave their houses and their families
They don't know how much they lose
CHORUS
I can see; I know how you could begin
But I'd lie, 'cause I know there's no way
I can see, I know how you could begin
But I'd lie; yes I'd lie
I know there is no way
VERSE 3
The sun never, never, never reaches here
The shadows have won
I'd leave if I knew the road from here
But I only knew it to here
CHORUS
I can see; I know how you could begin
But I'd lie, 'cause I know there's no way
I can see, I know how you could begin
But I'd lie; yes I'd lie
I know there is no way
OUTRO
I don't belong here
And I don't have to dance
I'll go where I came from
And I will leave my, leave my worries behind
