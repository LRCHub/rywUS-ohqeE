[00:13.63] It really shook you when I said
[00:20.01] "No one has ever looked so dead"
[00:29.14] Well, it's over and I can't go there anymore
[00:44.68] And in the backseat of your car
[01:00.18] 
[00:51.90] You showed me every single star
[00:59.28] And how the zenith and the sounds
[01:07.49] Re-change in every single town
[01:16.55] Well, it's over and I can't go there anymore
