It's written over window panes and glass
I can see the words on moon lit baths
Time can always turn on us so fast
No one will remember what we say

No one you pass knows about our past
So don't worry if you break my heart soon
Just let's end it all now not about ourselves
No point in reminiscing it's killing time

Finger prints on dusted canvas walls
Born a mental birds all bound in gold
No one ever reads them anymore
No one ever cared for what they said
No one can know
Our futures never sure

So don't worry if you
Don't know how or why
Someone will say
They know a better way
But don't listen to them
I mean no harm to you
L.A. L.A. L.A.
